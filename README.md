# Monazuki: Neon Trials

*Monazuki: Neon Trials* is a narrative, choice-based on-chain game on the *Monad Testnet*.  
Every run begins by burning one OE NFT as ‚Äúfuel.‚Äù You will navigate neon-lit scenes and pick your path. Some choices lead to victory, others end your run immediately.

## üéÆ How to Play
Go to our site first - https://monazuki.littlebunnyrocket.com/play.html
1. *Connect your wallet* (e.g. MetaMask) to the Monad Testnet.  
2. *Link your Monad Games ID (MGID)* via Privy and (optionally) bind it on-chain for the global leaderboard.  
3. Click *Load your NFT* to fetch your OE token IDs.  
4. Click *Start Game* ‚Üí input a tokenId to burn as fuel ‚Üí approve the transaction.  
5. Read the scene text and click one of the *Choose path* buttons to move forward.  
6. Side actions (leave a trail, rest, examine, offer) can also be performed. These count as extra activity and may trigger small native rewards.  
7. Reach the *Victory Scene* to earn points, and if you‚Äôre among the first 100 winners, you‚Äôll automatically receive the Monazuki Badge NFT.

> *Note:* If your run ends in Game Over, you‚Äôll need to start again by burning another OE NFT.
